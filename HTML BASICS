HMTL BASICS
HTML elements wrap our content and tell the browser how we wish to display things.
HTML elements are written as <start-tag>content</end-tag>.
HTML attributes can be added to the start tag <start-tag attribute="value">.
HTML's basic document structure is <html><head>...</head><body>...</body></html>.
HTML text can be formatted using a variety of tags such as heading, paragraph, and list.
HTML images look like <img src="myimage.jpg" alt="alternate text">.
HTML links look like <a href="myfile.html">link text here</a>.
We can validate our HTML code to check for syntax errors.

Typical structure
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Meta data for the browser and search engines -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Visible content area -->
  </body>
</html>

The Doctype (preceding document) tells the browser the version of HTML that it should interpret the document as. In the case of HTML5 you simply state <!DOCTYPE html>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>...</head>
  <body>...</body>
</html>
